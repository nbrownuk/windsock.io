This is a public repo for managing comments on my personal [blog website](https://windsock.io/). The site uses [giscus](https://giscus.app/) to provide a visitor commenting capability, which relies on GitHub Discussions to host the comments. Comments left on the site can be found here in the Discussion threads. To comment, visitors must authorize the [giscus app](https://github.com/apps/giscus) to [post on their behalf](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/identifying-and-authorizing-users-for-github-apps) using the GitHub OAuth flow. Alternatively, visitors can comment on the GitHub Discussion directly. You can moderate the comments on GitHub.
